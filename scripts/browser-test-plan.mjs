/**
 * browser-test-plan.mjs — choose the smallest browser gate that still covers a change.
 *
 * `gate-receipts.mjs` removes local-versus-local duplication for the static gates.
 * Neither it nor anything else touches the single most expensive run in this
 * repository:
 *
 *     npm run verify:ui   ->   646 Chromium tests, ~25 minutes
 *
 * CI repeats it wholesale. `Production UI critical` and the three `Production UI`
 * shards are guarded by `needs.changes.outputs.ui_changed == 'true'`, so for any
 * change that touches a browser surface the full suite runs on GitHub whether or
 * not it ran locally first. Measured on this repository 2026-09-02: two
 * consecutive changes ran the full local gate (25.0m and 20.5m), and between them
 * the focused selection for the same diffs took 37s and 6.1s and reached the same
 * verdict.
 *
 * Deferral — run the gate or hand it to CI wholesale — is not a safe lever here: a
 * UI change with no browser evidence at all before a push is not a bet this
 * repository takes. So the lever is a different one:
 *
 *     not "run it or skip it", but "run the part of it that can actually fail"
 *
 * Narrowing is strictly safer than deferring. Something always runs locally; what
 * changes is how much of the suite that cannot be affected by the diff is dragged
 * along with it.
 *
 * The levels, cheapest first. Each is chosen only when it can be justified from the
 * tree, never from a hand-maintained ownership table that rots in silence:
 *
 *   none      No browser surface changed. `ui_changed` is false, so CI skips its
 *             Production UI jobs too — nothing is left unrun by running nothing.
 *   changed   A `ui-*.spec.ts` file changed: run those specs COMPLETE. An edited
 *             spec is evidence about itself, and a grep inside it would be the
 *             author marking their own work.
 *   focused   Changed UI source, attributed to the specs that exercise it by an
 *             identifier both files contain — a `data-testid` the source renders,
 *             or a route the source defines and the spec navigates to.
 *   full      Shared foundations changed, or a changed UI file could not be
 *             attributed to any spec. Both are fail-closed: an unattributable
 *             change is treated exactly as CI treats unknown scope.
 *
 * Boundaries, all of them the conservative direction:
 *
 * - **Fail closed to `full`.** Every uncertainty — an unreadable file, a changed UI
 *   source with no owning spec, an unrecognised path — escalates. A bug here costs
 *   a full local run, never a missed one: deliberately the opposite direction from a
 *   fail-open check, because this planner's failure mode would be an unrun journey.
 * - **CI is never advised by this file.** It plans local work only. GitHub keeps
 *   running exactly what it runs today.
 * - **A narrowed run is not a full run.** The plan says which level it chose and
 *   what it is leaving to CI, and must be reported that way — "focused browser
 *   proof, full suite left to CI", never "the UI gate passed".
 * - **Dry-run by default**, like every other planner in `docs/productivity-workflows.md`.
 *   `--run` executes; nothing happens without it.
 *
