 * The one My Day read, shared by the `/my-day` page and the home card.
 *
 * Each source hook reads its mode's existing data the way that mode's own page
 * does, and maps it onto `MyDayItem` with that mode's own selectors. With
 * `enabled: false` (signed out) no source fetches anything.
 *
 * Admin and On Call are one source hook because both read the same On Call
 * entries; reading them once keeps a single network request and lets Admin
 * own the compliance-date rows without On Call repeating them.
