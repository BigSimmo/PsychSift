// Canonical category identity: which glyph and which accent a card wears.
//
// Before this module the answer was spread across at least ten independent maps
// and two of them disagreed. `launcherIconById` (applications-launcher-page.tsx)
// carried 13 tool ids; `iconByToolId` (tools-search-results-page.tsx) carried 8
// with a different fallback, so `guidelines`, `care-plans`, `safety-plan`,
// `calculators` and `monitoring` showed a real glyph on the launcher and a
// generic grid glyph on the results page. Colour diverged the same way: the
// launcher tinted by tool area, the results page painted every tile
// `--type-source`. One tool, two identities, depending on which screen you
// reached it from.
//
// Framework-free on purpose — no `lucide-react`, no JSX — so server code and
// data modules can name a glyph without pulling in the render layer. This is the
// same split `semantic-tone.ts` uses for `SEMANTIC_ICON_KEYS`, and the string
// key is also what lets the render boundary resolve icons through
// `createElement` rather than binding a capitalised component to a render-body
// local (which `react-hooks/static-components` forbids). Resolution lives in
// `src/components/category-identity-icons.ts`.
