 * The modes that register nothing. Psychiatry's home is

 *
 * Each used to carry one `action: "search"` entry rendering a lone <button>
 * inside its own <nav> landmark, whose only effect was focusing a composer
 * already on screen. Every one is genuinely single-surface, so the control was
 * deleted rather than ported to the shared bar.
 *
 * On Call was briefly a ninth, for a different reason: all of its routes are
 * information pages, so `PageSecondaryNavigation` returns null on every one of
 * them and the SHELL can never render this mode's bar. The conclusion drawn then
 * was that the bar could not work here and the destinations were deleted. It was
 * the wrong conclusion — a page that owns its header navigation mounts the bar
 * itself, which is what `OnCallSectionPage` and `OnCallHome` now do — so the
 * mode has left this list.
