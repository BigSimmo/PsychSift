# PsychSift Documentation Index

_Updated 2026-10-08 — catalogue Context7 and CME guides; clarify issue authority; Documentation owns._

Categorised map of every tracked Markdown document under `docs/`: the load-bearing docs lead
each category, and an "Also catalogued" list completes it (the immutable
`branch-review-records/` and `outstanding-issues-inbox/` files are indexed by their own
generators, not here). Categories distinguish **maintained** documents (keep these current when
behavior changes) from **point-in-time records** (historical; do not update, supersede with a
new dated doc instead). No check fails when a document is missing from this index, so add each
new document here when you write it. Owner decisions are indexed separately in
[decisions/README.md](decisions/README.md).

Check that repo paths referenced from the maintained docs still resolve with:

```bash
npm run docs:check-links
```

## Start here

Choose the task and the kind of evidence before following an instruction:

| Need                                 | Entry point                                                            | Read it as                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PsychSift development                | [Repository README](../README.md), [codebase index](codebase-index.md) | Setup and architecture, subject to the current manifests and provider boundaries |
| Agent instructions or platform setup | [Task navigator](agents-guide.md), [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)           | Find the applicable rule; do not run every referenced workflow                   |
| Current work or acceptance           | The existing task checkpoint                                           | Check its identity, scope and evidence before relying on its status              |
| A past decision or incident          | The historical records below                                           | Evidence of what happened then, not a current completion or deployment claim     |

## Documentation ownership and maintenance

| Document type                                  | How to maintain it                                                                                                                  | What its presence proves                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maintained guide or runbook                    | Correct the relevant source and necessary references when behaviour changes. Check commands against the current script definitions. | Instructions exist; current execution and access still need evidence.                 |
| Generated index or snapshot                    | Use its named generator and inspect the resulting diff. Do not hand-edit generated facts or run unrelated generators.               | The recorded inventory or snapshot, within its declared scope and capture conditions. |
| Task checkpoint                                | Keep one current record per task with ownership, scope, decisions, evidence, blockers and next action. Preserve concurrent work.    | Reported task status, which must be reconciled with the actual working state.         |
| Historical report, lesson or immutable receipt | Preserve the original record; add a dated correction or superseding reference through the appropriate workflow.                     | Historical evidence, including its original failures and limitations.                 |

Use `npm run docs:check-links` for maintained-document references and
`npm run docs:check-scripts` for npm script references. These are static checks;
they do not prove that instructions are semantically correct, providers work or a
screen matches its design. When the checker is blocked, report that limitation
and use a clearly scoped check for the affected documents without weakening the
repository gate. The generated inventories remain governed by their own contracts.

## Point-in-time records (historical — do not update)

Dated status reports, reviews, and operator decisions. They describe the repo
as it was on that date; supersede with a new dated document rather than editing.

- [dsm5tr-handover-reconciliation-2026-09-16.md](dsm5tr-handover-reconciliation-2026-09-16.md) — DSM-5-TR and Sources handover reconciled against HEAD 66105e1: the criteria-provenance fix that shipped, the disposition of all 30 claims, the four items held for owner approval, and why 0 of the 24 supplied sources pass the native acquisition gate
- [dsm5tr-approvals-queue.md](dsm5tr-approvals-queue.md) — what the DSM-5-TR handover leaves waiting on a person: 16 claims and 9 information concepts needing clinical sign-off, the seven rights questions per source across all 24, and the metadata 17 sources do not print
- [audit/](audit/) — repo and UX/accessibility audits
- [audit/full-repository-audit-2026-09-02.md](audit/full-repository-audit-2026-09-02.md) — full repository audit (25 lanes, independently verified findings, closed-off sub-projects, machine evidence, Stage-5 adversarial review; audit only, nothing acted on except one-line documentation corrections)
- [audit/2026-07-20-repository-maturity.md](audit/2026-07-20-repository-maturity.md) — full repository maturity, mapping, and organisation audit
- [audit/latency-audit-2026-07-28.md](audit/latency-audit-2026-07-28.md) — latency audit: server, client, and database findings by tier, with the already-cleared list
- [audit/audit-handover-2026-07-14.md](audit/audit-handover-2026-07-14.md) — multi-skill repository audit findings inventory
- [audit/audit-remediation-plan-2026-07-14.md](audit/audit-remediation-plan-2026-07-14.md) — sequenced remediation plan for the 2026-07-14 audit, with the 2026-07-17 reconciliation
- [audit/design-audit-2026-07-17.md](audit/design-audit-2026-07-17.md) — repository-wide design, accessibility, and interaction audit
- [audit/cloud-connection-acceptance-2026-08-05.md](audit/cloud-connection-acceptance-2026-08-05.md) — hosted versus local MCP boundary acceptance, Personal Pro split control plane, and remaining Cloud launcher blockers
- [audit/claude-code-cloud-connection-acceptance-2026-08-17.md](audit/claude-code-cloud-connection-acceptance-2026-08-17.md) — Claude Code desktop-vs-cloud connector parity check (Railway/Figma/Sentry/Supabase/GitHub live-verified), dependency-currency hook, open Supabase-scope and GitHub-portability items
- [audit/2026-09-17-external-audit-refutations.md](audit/2026-09-17-external-audit-refutations.md) — what the 2026-09-17 external audit got wrong and why: it read a commit 31 behind `main`, eight findings refuted with evidence (four re-verified 2026-09-18), which findings were real but already decided, and the two questions still worth a person
- [audit/2026-09-16-catalogue-read-latency.md](audit/2026-09-16-catalogue-read-latency.md) — every public catalogue read re-hashed the whole 9.5 MB frozen corpus (live mean 8,656 ms, max 17,263 ms); mitigated in the application, root cause still needs a migration and an approved window
- [audit/2026-09-16-registry-search-outage.md](audit/2026-09-16-registry-search-outage.md) — why registry search returned nothing for seven days; same read path as the catalogue-latency record, different defect
- [audit/psychsift-differentials-handover-reconciliation-2026-09-16.md](audit/psychsift-differentials-handover-reconciliation-2026-09-16.md) — the Differentials handover reconciled against repository records: why the evidence adapter is blocked, and the claim-to-record mapping the package cannot supply
- [audit/codex-cloud-reliability-20260907.md](audit/codex-cloud-reliability-20260907.md) — Codex Cloud reliability record, 2026-09-07

- [tooling-follow-through-decisions-2026-08-12.md](tooling-follow-through-decisions-2026-08-12.md) — ledger #150 CodeRabbit cap policy and #151 GitHub Actions observation fallback
- [staging-shutdown-and-repo-review-handover-2026-09-06.md](staging-shutdown-and-repo-review-handover-2026-09-06.md) — why shutting staging down does not block drift detection or repair (and what it does block), plus three off-ledger findings: the open SaMD classification on a live patient-specific feature, the spend threshold that alerts without enforcing, and unreachable password sign-in
- [evidence/forms-operational-guidance-review.md](evidence/forms-operational-guidance-review.md) — generated sign-off sheet: what the Forms mode displays for each of the 54 forms, the sections and approved form it was drafted from, and how a reviewer records sign-off one form at a time (`npm run forms:review-sheet`)
- [evidence/forms-pdf-publisher-comparison-2026-09-16.md](evidence/forms-pdf-publisher-comparison-2026-09-16.md) — byte comparison of all 51 approved-form PDFs against the Office of the Chief Psychiatrist's own URLs (51 of 51 identical), the same-day register reconciliation of all 54 codes and availability states, and the Form 10G register typo this repository does not copy
- [wa-mha-forms-handover-reconciliation-2026-09-16.md](wa-mha-forms-handover-reconciliation-2026-09-16.md) — reconciliation receipt for the portable WA MHA Forms/Sources handover: what the Forms catalogue actually carried (40 of 54 forms on PDF-indexing scaffolding or the generic fallback), what landed, the zero-insert source preview and its single Act URL conflict, and the open clinical sign-off, Act-currency and asset gates
- [source-governance-refresh-worklist-2026-07-22.md](source-governance-refresh-worklist-2026-07-22.md) — ledger #022 worklist and BMJ attestation policy status
- [specifier-definition-worklist-2026-09-18.md](specifier-definition-worklist-2026-09-18.md) — issue #693 clinical worklist for the 585-item specifier catalogue: why "71 defined" is really 14, that nothing carries clinician sign-off, the A/B/C triage split, the 63 management-changing items in full, and a worked example of what a completed entry must contain
- [specifier-entry-worksheet-with-catatonia.md](specifier-entry-worksheet-with-catatonia.md) — the first specifier entry laid out for completion: one shared definition, nine per-disorder rows, the exact field changes, and the sign-off block, with every clinical statement blank
- `release-source-metadata-debt-2026-06-30.json` — captured source-metadata debt policy, consumed by `npm run audit:source-governance:release` and `npm run eval:quality:release`
- [forward-codify-retrieval-rpcs-workorder.md](forward-codify-retrieval-rpcs-workorder.md) — completed retrieval RPC codification workorder

## Archive

- [archive/](archive/) — completed phase plans, superseded designs, and old
  progress logs kept for provenance. Never treat archive content as current
  guidance.

## Maintenance rules

- Generated files (`site-map.md`) are updated only via their generator scripts.
- When adding a doc, add it to the matching section here; date the filename if
  it is a point-in-time record.
- When a maintained doc is superseded, move it to `archive/` and update inbound
  links (`npm run docs:check-links` finds broken ones).
